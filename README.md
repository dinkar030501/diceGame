Dice game with following rules:
- When new game is begun then the player 1 (i.e. left side player) starts with rolling the dice
- The random dice numbers are added and are visible on screen
- Player can click on hold 📥 whenever he wants to and the current value is added to the score of the player and the players are switch
- Goal is to reach 100 points first 🏁
- Easy right?
- Just one issue... there is a special rule 👻: If the player rolls and it results in 1 on the dice then the current value is changed to 0 and players are switched and this give other player to add score.

Ok then good luck with the game 👍... btw following are some screenshots of the game:
